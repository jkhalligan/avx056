There are companies out there, like InheritNOW, who are willing to advance you a portion of your inheritance in exchange for a fee that is collected when probate closes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how an inheritance advance works: First, the company who provides the advance confirms the value of your inheritance. They then make you an inheritance advance offer\u2014advancing you a percentage of your entire inheritance for a fee, which is &nbsp;collected after the <a href=\"https:\/\/inheritnow.com\/fr\/glossary\/#estate\">estate<\/a> closes. Once you agree, you tell them how much you\u2019d like advanced and they send you the funds right away. You get the money fast, and they do all the waiting for the estate to close. At that time, the company collects their fee, and you receive the balance of your inheritance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what do you need to get an inheritance advance started? In order for a company to offer you an advance, they need to assess and confirm the value of your inheritance. They can do this quickly with some key bits of information, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Information relating to a probate case including the probate case number, court name and location.<\/li><li>Name and contact information of the <a href=\"https:\/\/inheritnow.com\/fr\/glossary\/#executor\">executor<\/a> and\/or estate attorney, we can then gather the following information from them:<ul><li>The death certificate of the deceased person from whom you will inherit<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/inheritnow.com\/fr\/glossary\/#will\">will<\/a>, if you have it (not always necessary, but helpful)<\/li><li>The mortgage statement of any real estate that is included in the inheritance<\/li><li>Appraisal report of any real estate included in the inheritance<\/li><li>Appraisal report for any business included in the inheritance<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s all you need to apply for an advance on your inheritance. Remember, an inheritance advance is not a loan\u2014it is simply your inheritance money delivered sooner\u2014so there are never any payments to make, or anything to pay back whatsoever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like an inheritance advance offer for your inheritance, click here.
